<h3>What is Autism</h3>
<ol>
<li>A serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact.</li>

<li>Treatment can help, but this condition can't be cured.</li> 

<li>Chronic: can last for years or be lifelong.</li>

<li>Requires a medical diagnosis.</li>

<li>Affects the overall cognitive, emotional, social and physical health of the affected individual.</li>

<li>Difficulty with communication, difficulty with social interactions, obsessive interests and repetitive behaviours.</li>

<li>Autism is a lifelong developmental condition.</li>

<li>Autism affects almost four times as many boys than girls.</li>

<li>Spectrum defines the degree and range of their affection.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<ol>
<li>Autism has increased.</li>
 
<li>Was not Taken Care earlier(21  year old Example).</li>

<li>Diagnosis not done with any test or check but with observation.</li>

<li>Diagnosis has increased.</li>

<li>Autism Check List 12-15 years.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>&nbspThe different types of treatments can generally be broken down into the following categories:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: bold">
<li>Behavior and Communication Approaches.</li>
<li>Dietary Approaches.</li>
<li>Medication.</li>
<li>Complementary and Alternative Medicine</li>
</ol>

<p>Intervention can involve behavioral treatments, medicines or both.
Typically, different interventions and supports become appropriate as a child develops and acquires social and learning skills.
The intensive interventions described here require multiple hours per week of therapy, and address behavioral, developmental, and/or educational goals. They are developed specifically to treat autism. During the course of treatment, it may be necessary to reevaluate which method is best for your child.
Children with other disorders.
Each child or adult with autism is unique. Treatments and supports that work for one may not work for another. As a result, each person’s treatment plan should follow a thorough evaluation of strengths as well as challenges.

Do Children or Adults Diagnosed with Autism Ever Move Off "the Spectrum"? </p>

<h4>1.Early intervention for autism: Early intervention involves a child's entire family working closely with a team of professionals.</h4>

<h4>2.Intervention for school-age children.</h4>

<h4>3.Therapies and supports for adults:</h4>


 <p>Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is one practical, skill-building approach that has helped many people on the autism spectrum.
 It involves examining problematic beliefs and behaviors, and so, is best suited for those who can communicate through verbal or nonverbal means. 
 <br><br>
 Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), though developed and studied primarily in children, also helps some adults on the autism spectrum. 
</p>

 <h3>Behavior and Communication Approaches.</h3>
 <ol style="font-weight: bold">
 <li>Applied Behaviour Analysis(ABA)</li>
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li>Discrete Trial Training (DTT) : series of trials to teach each step of a desired behavior.  </li>
 <li>Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI): very young children.  </li>
 <li>Pivotal Response Training (PRT): increase a child’s motivation to learn, monitor his own behavior,and initiate communication(positive reinforcement,child directed and not special behaviour as in DTT).  </li>
 <li>Verbal Behavior Intervention (VBI): focuses on teaching verbal skills.(B.F Skinner, language could be grouped into a set of units, which he called operants. Each operant he identified serves a different function. He listed echoics, mands, tacts and intraverbals as the most important of these operants)  </li>
   </ul><br>

<li>Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-Based Approach (DIR; also called “Floortime”): Emotional,realtional development.</li><br>
       
<li>TEACHH(Training and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children): uses visual cues ex: dressing.</li><br>
     
 <li> Social Communication/ Emotional Regulation/ Transactional Support (SCERTS): ability to learn and spontaneously apply functional and relevant skills in a variety of settings and with a variety of partners.</li><br>
     
 <li>Occupational Threrapy: teaches skills that help the person live as independently as possible. Skills might include dressing, eating, bathing, and relating to people.</li><br>

 <li>Sensory Integration Therapy: sights and senses.for children who do not like to be touched.</li><br>
     
 <li>Speech Therapy : verbal communication skills. gestures and pictures.</li><br>
    
 <li>The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): Uses pictures to teach them to answer and indulge in a conversation.</li><br>

<h4>
Notes - 
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maybe some statement gets stuck in their brain, and they ignore other succeeding statements.
<li>some have easier time singing rather than actual conversation (Maybe because it doesn't require cognitive skills and are rythmic).
<li>therapy can bring big improvements. Important for a child to get therapies at an early stage.

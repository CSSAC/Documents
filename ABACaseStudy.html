MITA (works on PRT - ABA)

PRT method works on Pivotal Areas of development. Through proper pivotal learning, a complex understanding of an instruction can be achieved.
For example - imagine that you are asked to pick up a red crayon that has fallen under the table. This may seem like a trivial task, but in order to accomplish it successfully, you need to notice three different features, or “cues,” of the object: its color (red), its shape (crayon) and its location (under the table). You must then mentally integrate all three pieces of information into a new mental image, a red crayon under the table, in order to take the correct action. 

Visual commands are more effective than verbal commands (Showing multiple cues.)

Visual Training in recognising Shape, Size and Colour.
These training starts with single cues, then move on to two cues and then all of them combined.
